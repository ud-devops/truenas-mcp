### Security Notes
- **Credential Storage**: Credentials are stored in TrueNAS configuration

  - Use Kerberos principals with keytabs instead of passwords for production
  - Ensure DNS is properly configured before joining
  - Verify network connectivity to directory service
  - Test with dry-run mode before executing operations
- **Requirements**:
  - DNS resolution must work for the domain
  - Network access to directory service (ports 389/636 for LDAP, 88/464 for Kerberos)
  - Time synchronization between TrueNAS and directory service

### Credential Type Reference

**Active Directory Credentials:**
```json
// Username and password (simpler but less secure)
{"type": "KERBEROS_USER", "username": "admin@CORP.EXAMPLE.COM", "password": "********"}

// Principal with keytab (more secure, recommended for production)
{"type": "KERBEROS_PRINCIPAL", "principal": "host/truenas.corp.example.com", "keytab": "[masked]"}
```

**LDAP Credentials:**
```json
// Plain authentication with bind DN
{"type": "LDAP_PLAIN", "binddn": "cn=admin,dc=example,dc=com", "bindpw": "********"}

// Anonymous (no credentials)
{"type": "LDAP_ANONYMOUS"}

// Mutual TLS with client certificate
{"type": "LDAP_MTLS", "certificate_id": 123}

// Kerberos authentication (same as Active Directory)
{"type": "KERBEROS_USER", "username": "admin", "password": "********"}
{"type": "KERBEROS_PRINCIPAL", "principal": "host/truenas", "keytab": "[masked]"}
```

**IPA/FreeIPA Credentials:**
```json
// Same as Active Directory Kerberos options
{"type": "KERBEROS_USER", "username": "admin", "password": "********"}
{"type": "KERBEROS_PRINCIPAL", "principal": "host/truenas", "keytab": "[masked]"}
```

## System Update and Maintenance

### Recommended System Update Workflow

1. **Before Update**: Check current state
   - Check for TrueNAS system updates (`check_updates`)
   - Check current boot environment (`get_current_boot_environment`)
   - List boot environments to know baseline (`query_boot_environments`)

2. **Download Update**: Get update files
   - Download update (dry run first for preview: `download_update` with `dry_run: true`)
   - Monitor progress with `update_status`

3. **Apply Update**: Install and reboot
   - Apply update (dry run first: `apply_update` with `dry_run: true`)
   - Apply update with reboot (`apply_update` with `reboot: true`)

4. **After Update**: Verify new system
   - Check system health (`system_health`)
   - List boot environments (verify new one exists: `query_boot_environments`)
   - Test system functionality

5. **Cleanup** (optional, after verifying system works):
   - List deletable boot environments (`query_boot_environments` with `show_deletable_only: true`)
   - Delete old boot environments (dry run first: `delete_boot_environment` with `dry_run: true`)
   - Keep at least 2-3 boot environments for recovery

### Available Tools

- **check_updates** - Check for available TrueNAS system updates
  - Queries TrueNAS update servers for new versions
  - Shows available update details and release notes
  - No system changes, safe to run anytime

- **download_update** - Download TrueNAS system update files
  - Downloads update files to the system
  - Supports dry-run mode to preview what will be downloaded
  - Returns a task ID for tracking download progress
  - Does not apply the update (use apply_update after download completes)

- **apply_update** - Apply downloaded TrueNAS system update
  - Applies previously downloaded system update
  - Optional automatic reboot after update (default: false for safety)
  - Supports dry-run mode to preview update actions
  - Returns a task ID for tracking update progress
  - Creates a new boot environment automatically
  - **Best Practice**: After successful update and reboot, use query_boot_environments to check for old boot environments that can be safely pruned with delete_boot_environment. Recommend keeping 2-3 recent boot environments for rollback safety.
  - **WARNING**: This will update your TrueNAS system - ensure backups are current

- **update_status** - Get current system update status and progress

  - Automatic background polling of TrueNAS job status
  - Tasks update automatically without manual polling

## Snapshot Lifecycle

Snapshots were previously queryable but not manageable, which left out the most
common recovery workflow: take a snapshot before a risky change, roll back if it
breaks.

### `create_snapshot`
Create a snapshot of a dataset or zvol.
- `dataset` (required) - dataset to snapshot, e.g. `tank/data`
- `name` (required) - the part after `@`, e.g. `before-upgrade`
- `recursive` - also snapshot child datasets

The dataset and name are validated before the call, so passing `tank/data@x` as
the dataset produces a clear error rather than a middleware traceback.

### `delete_snapshot`
Destroy a snapshot. Supports `dry_run`, which reports the snapshot's current
size and referenced data before you commit.
- `snapshot` (required) - full `dataset@snapshot` name
- `recursive` - also delete identically named child snapshots

### `rollback_snapshot`
Roll a dataset back to a snapshot. **Destructive**: everything written after
that snapshot is discarded.
- `snapshot` (required) - full `dataset@snapshot` name
- `force` - destroy newer snapshots that block the rollback
- `dry_run` - list exactly which newer snapshots would be destroyed

`dry_run` is worth using every time here: it queries the newer snapshots and
names them, so the user can see what `force` would cost before agreeing to it.

### `query_snapshot_tasks`
List periodic snapshot tasks — which datasets are snapshotted automatically, on
what schedule, and with what retention. This is how you answer "is this dataset
actually protected?" rather than assuming it is.

## Infrastructure Visibility

Read-only tools covering the parts of TrueNAS that previously required leaving
the assistant and opening the web UI. All are safe in `--read-only` mode.

| Tool | Answers |
| --- | --- |
| `query_services` | Is SMB/NFS/iSCSI/SSH running, and does it start at boot? |
| `query_disks` | Model, serial, size and pool membership; which disks are unassigned |
| `query_users` | Accounts, UIDs, groups, shells, whether an account is locked |
| `query_groups` | Groups, GIDs, membership |
| `query_replication_tasks` | Are off-site copies configured, enabled and succeeding? |
| `query_cloudsync_tasks` | Cloud sync direction, schedule and last run state |
| `query_certificates` | Common names, SANs, issuers and expiry dates |
| `query_iscsi_targets` | Block storage exported to hypervisors |

Each accepts a `limit` and a substring filter on the most useful field.

**Secrets are excluded by field selection, not by trusting the middleware.**
`query_users` never returns password hashes or SSH keys, `query_cloudsync_tasks`
never returns provider credentials, and `query_certificates` never returns
private keys or CSRs — the handlers project a fixed allowlist of fields rather
than forwarding whatever the API happened to include.
